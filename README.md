## Blockchain Development Assignment (C Language)

This project simulates core blockchain mechanisms using the C programming language. It is designed to provide hands-on experience with:

- Cryptographic hashing (SHA-256)
- Proof-of-Work mining
- Block structuring and integrity checks
- UTXO and Account/Balance transaction models
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment in blockchain mining

Through these simulations, the assignment reinforces fundamental blockchain principles such as immutability, decentralized consensus, and secure transaction recording.

### Requirements
- C Compiler (e.g., GCC)
- OpenSSL (for SHA-256 hashing)
- Basic familiarity with:
    - C data structures and pointers
    - File and memory management
    - Cryptographic hashing concepts
